My bsc thesis project - a telegram chat-bot made with python. 

  I have explained the process of development of a telegram chatbot which leverages different machine learning and deep learning technologies and its deployment to aws server. The chatbot is able to enter different modes using commands and messages. 
The bot is capable of: 
1. Having a basic conversation.
2. Tell a joke and understand the user's reaction.
3. Recognize a handwritten digit from an image that was sent to it.
The system was built using python-telegram-bot API, openCV, Tensorflow & Keras, Dialogflow and other python packages.
