# py-bot-yuri
My ongoing project - a telegram chat-bot made with python. 

  The main goal of the project is to explain the process of development and deployment of a telegram chatbot to aws server, which would include different machine learning and deep learning methods. The chatbot is able to enter different modes using commands and messages. 
The bot is capable of: 
1. Having a basic conversation.
2. Tell a joke and understand the user's reaction.
3. Recognize a handwritten digit from an image that was sent to it.
The system was built using python-telegram-bot API, openCV, Tensorflow & Keras, Dialogflow and other python packages.
