# py-bot-Yuri
My ongoing project - a telegram chat-bot made with python. 

  The main goal of the project is to explain the process of development and deployment of a telegram chatbot to aws server, which would include different machine learning and deep learning methods. The chatbot is going to be able to enter different modes using commands and messages. One of those is going to be generative mode, when the chatbot would improvise unique answers. Another goal is to add a function which would allow the bot to analyze some data and try to answer questions. The final goal is to deploy it to the server to make it fully accessible to anyone using Telegram application.
  The bot is deployed to amazon ec-2 machine.

  The generative mode is going o be implemented using OpenAI's gpt-2 model
